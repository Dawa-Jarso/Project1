# Aviation Accident Risk Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes aviation accident data to support strategic decision-making for a company expanding into the aviation industry. Using historical records from 1948–2022, we examine accident patterns across manufacturers, engine configurations, and aircraft types.  

## Dataset  
- **Source:** Public aviation accident dataset  
- **Period Covered:** 1948–2022  
- **Size:** [88889,25] 
- **Key Features:** Aircraft manufacturer, model, engine type, number of engines, accident dates, and other attributes  

## Objectives  
1. Identify manufacturers with the least accident frequencies.  
2. Assess the relationship between aircraft engine configurations and accident counts.  
3. Provide insights into safer investment and expansion opportunities.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
- **Visualization:** Tableau dashboard for interactive exploration  
- **Notebook:** Jupyter for analysis and documentation  

## Key Findings  
- Manufacturers with higher accident frequencies should be approached cautiously.  
- Aircraft with more engines generally show lower accident counts, suggesting design complexity may reduce risks.  

## Deliverables  
- Jupyter notebook with cleaned dataset and analysis  
- Tableau dashboard for interactive visualization  
- Presentation summarizing findings and recommendations  
- README file (this document)  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd aviation-accident-analysis
